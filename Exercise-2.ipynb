    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercise for this week is meant to help you better understand data types and lists in Python, and practice saving changes to your files using Git and GitHub.\n",
    "Below you have a series of \"problems\" that you will be asked to solve by either modifying a starter code in a Jupyter notebook, or creating your own code in the notebook.\n",
    "After making your changes, you will need to push them to GitHub using Git.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What to do\n",
    "\n",
    "Your answers for each problem should go between the corresponding sub-sections titled \"Problem X answer section starts here\" and \"Problem X answer section ends here\".\n",
    "This exercise is worth **20 points** and due by the start of class on 19.9.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where to find help\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're having trouble, please remember you can\n",
    "\n",
    "- Come to the work sessions on Thursday and/or Friday for help from the course assistants\n",
    "- Find [hints about this week's exercise](https://geo-python.github.io/2018/lessons/L2/exercise-2.html) on the course webpage\n",
    "- Post questions to Slack"
