    "The exercise for this week is meant to help you better understand data types and lists in Python, and practice saving changes to your files using Git and GitHub.\n",
    "Below you have a series of \"problems\" that you will be asked to solve by either modifying a starter code in a Jupyter notebook, or creating your own code in the notebook.\n",
    "After making your changes, you will need to push them to GitHub using Git.\n",
